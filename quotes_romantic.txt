A beautiful woman delights the eye; a wise one, the understanding; a pure one, the soul.
When you look at me, when you think of me, I am in paradise.
Romance is tempestuous. Love is calm.
All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.
If a June night could talk, it would probably boast it invented romance.
If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.
Kiss me and you will see how important I am.
What is love? It is the morning and the evening star.
When I walk with you I feel as if I had a flower in my buttonhole.
So the lover must struggle for words.
Love alone could waken love.
I am in you and you in me, mutual in divine love.
Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star.
In short I will part with anything for you but you.
When the heart speaks, its language is the same under all latitudes.
I love you - I am at rest with you - I have come home.
Love is friendship set on fire.
When I give I give myself.
A boy is holding a girl so very tight in his arms tonight.
I'm very romantic. I've emptied flower shops.
I'm very romantic, I'm extremely romantic. I date my wife.
Tradition wears a snowy beard, romance is always young.
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter.
There is no instinct like that of the heart.
O, thou art fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars.
My heart is like a singing bird.
Morning without you is a dwindled dawn.
Love makes life live.
It is better to have loved and lost than never to have lost at all.
Words of love, are works of love.
